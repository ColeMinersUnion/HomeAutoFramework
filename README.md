# HomeAutoFramework

This is a project I've been working on this summer that originally started because I wanted to turn my light off without getting out of bed. It's evolved and become more broad. I use a Websocket (best hosted on a raspberry pi) to route all the connections. Then I'm designing an app using kivy to handle all the connections and act as a controller for all the devices. Next I'm using raspberry pi pico Ws along with relay modules to act act as switches for all the lamps, outlets, whatever I end up doing with that.
